# LED Matrix DateTime

This sketch shows current date (in Roman numerals), time and an Atari logo on a 64x64 LED Matrix using Adafruit GFX library.

It is developed for WeMos D1 mini (ESP8266) and 64x64 (32S) LED Matrix, but can be easily adjusted to run on an ESP32 and a matrix of other dimensions.

First install the ESP8266 board using these instructions:
